  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <h3>My name is Evan Tichenor, and I like to create things.</h3>
  <p>
    I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Georgia.<br/>
    I am a software developer at the <a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu/">Small Satellite Research Lab</a> at UGA.<br/>
    My <a href="https://github.com/EvanTich">GitHub</a> has many of my projects.<br/>
  </p>
  <h4>More Complexity?</h4>
  <p>
    There's something to say about the simplicity of my website: its efficient.
    Sure, I <i>could</i> make it look better, but it would function the same.
    I <i>could</i> use jQuery or Bootstrap, but those are bulky.
    This <b>pure efficiency</b> allows my website the ability to be loaded and viewed from any device anywhere.
    Huge libraries with huge amounts of functionality that ultimately goes unused should not be used on websites that could be much smaller otherwise.

  <h4>Simplicity</h4>
  <p>
    That's not to say that websites can't look good without huge front-end frameworks holding them up.
    Just use some <i>*gasp*</i> custom CSS when you need things to look spiffy.
    And when you can't seem to quite figure out it out, just remember: nobody really cares.
    People will probably remember your website because its fairly unique. Just let you do you.
  </p>

    Disclaimer: This is only mostly a joke. I'm not a web developer (unless I get hired to be one).
