    <h1>IN PROGRESS</h1>
    <!-- TODO: Title! -->
    <p>
      Recently I re-setup my IP configuration on a machine I'm using as a server.
      I'm currently running an SSH server and a Minecraft server on the machine (this becomes important later).
      <aside class="gray">Important note: the machine is using Arch Linux, which is notorious for being difficult to manage (but has some nice pros too!).</aside>
      It was a pain in my ass. It shouldn't have been, but it was.
      I'm going to tell you the result of this process before I get into the nitty-gritty of it because I think it will be more interesting and informative that way.
    </p>
    <h4>The Results</h4>
    <p>
      The results were as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>A proper static IP address</li>
        <li>A functioning routing table</li>
        <li>Access to DNS nameservers</li>
        <li>A port-forwarded Arch Linux server</li>
      </ul>
      These results might not seem like much, but they were hard fought for.
    </p>
    <h4>The Beginning</h4>
    <p>
<!-- outline:
        - try to access server (connect to minecraft server)
        - try to access ssh (not working)
        - Dad sends picture of speedtest saying the house just got fiber (nice but my server is now broke)
            - aside for the speed of fiber (4-5 ms ping and Gb up/down; WOW)
        - Port forwarding (ez)
        - flush ips
        - fixing the ip using network manager
        - rouge 10.0.0.11 ip being added to the device (this will be fixed at the very end)
        - flush routes
        - fix the routes
        - ABLE TO ACCESS MACHINE THROUGH SSH!
        - dns issues
        - said fuck it, destory everything in network manager
        - sadness
            - think about network manager
        - stop and disable network manager
        - flush ip, add ip
        - flush routes, add routes
        - put dns in /etc/resolv.conf (thank you https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration#Check_the_connection)
        - noticed /etc/resolv.conf was changed by dhcpcd, stopped and disabled it through systemctl
            - dhcpcd is what was probably adding the rouge ip too (son of a bitch)
        - ultimately this was a temporary solution, probably going to go back to NetworkManager

    I had the server setup with a static IP address
